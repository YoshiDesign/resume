This game is being completely rebuilt and will be in development for some time whilst I tackle other endeavors. In summary, tweets are given a natural language sentiment-analysis to determine the difficulty of the gameplay. Each Twitter handle can invoke custom settings, which I found to be the most alluring element (as did a few hundred Redditors). Once the scene is ready, tweets from any user's timeline are streamed to the player in realtime, and can be destroyed character-by-character. <p><b>The Python version can be found from the GitHub link, however at this time you'll need your own upstream Twitter-API to retrieve any tweets.</b></p>",
