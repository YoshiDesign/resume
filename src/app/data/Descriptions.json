                    "desc"  : "My World Works is a collection of maps that I've turned into interactive objects for individuals to analyze all kinds of nation-wide economic statistics. The complete scope of this project has proven to be much too large for one developer to manage but it has yielded an amazing foundation to build and maintain my skills in fullstack software and DevOps, as well as information and cyber security, all whilst also creating something with great future potential. In it's entirety, My World Works holds the structural capacity and promotes the architectural designs to store vast amounts of comprehensive, searchable data and create modestly detailed visualizations for over 140 different countries, and for each individual city where data is available. As someone who enjoys being abroad, I would love to be able to analyze a nation's econonomy in great detail, especially if I were to live and work from wherever that might be. In its current state, the app accomplishes just that, but for only 1 country, which I will explain further in just a moment! The inspiration behind this project is multi-faceted: I wanted to assist people who were seeking to optimize their work/life balance by enabling a visually comprehensisve comparison of cost-of-living data alongside very specific workforce statistics at varying levels of detail. Despite the app's pre-alpha state, users based in the USA can already make different discoveries such as where jobs are most available or most popular, and assuming my information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (and several other sources) is reliable enough, this could improve an individual's sense of job security based on either the density or lack of certain metrics. With enough analysis, user's might be able to make their own inferences from the data. The reliability of the data would certainly improve over time with the right amount of management and marketing, but those ideas remain out of scope for the time being. With the help of Redis, querying large amounts of data remains relatively high-throughput and very performant as I've constructed a custom type-ahead search tree using the data structures and algorithms I learned early in my self-education; though I still have optimizations in mind. I eventually refactored the architecture so the app could bring similarly vast data-sets to all of the countries you'll find in the app. Each country has a complete data-set under the more general Economics feature (courtesy of The World Bank organization), but the USA remains my only complete data-set for even more useful features.<p>At the moment I have no intention to acquire the immeasurable amounts of missing data on my own. The data-sets are complete for the United States, which is a great milestone, and until I endeavor to put another country on the map, I am happy to hack away upon the architecure and systems I currently have in place. The scope is just too large for one developer but the app remains excellent sandbox, if not a potentially useful tool for some.</p><p><b>To fully demonstrate this app, you can choose The United States from the Economics tab, which enables the Work and Life tabs. The USA is the only country that currentlty activates those features, due to the reasons I've described above. Collecting reliable information on several different countries will be a very time consuming process, to say the least!</b></p><p>To prospect a little bit, once I've aggregated the necessary data for other nations, enabling the more highly detailed features boils down to a very simple update, so I am very excited to continue building and collecting data in the future. There are several challenges that reach beyond data collection and storage which one could imagine. The challenges ahead might surely bring this app to its full potential, and the nature those challenges cover a broad range of classifications. There are architectural and systematic designs which will assist in data collection and help to automate the generation and storage of aggregates, as well as researching even more effective means of its use. And there are also the more logistic and even bureaucratic tasks in terms of usage, validation and collection of data. If this app ever were to be used by a large number of users I would like to find a way to administer surveys to willing respondents who can help keep a country's economy as transparent and honest as possible. I truly think that a tool like this could help many people in many ways.</p>",
