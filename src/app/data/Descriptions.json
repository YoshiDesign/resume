                    "desc"  : "My World Works is a collection of maps that I've turned into interactive objects for individuals to analyze all kinds of nation-wide economic statistics. This has been a massive personal undertaking, and this project yields the capacity to store multitudes of comprehensive, searchable data visualizations for over 140 different countries. The inspiration behind this project is multi-faceted: I wanted to assist people who were seeking to optimize their work/life balance by enabling the comparison of cost-of-living data alongside workforce statistics. Users could also discover where jobs are most available, improving your sense of job security by analyzing workforce density in specific fields. Even more use-cases come about due to the potential for making inferences from such a large amount of data; that being brought directly to the user's eyes in many cases. I eventually refactored the architecture so the app could bring similar data-sets to any country for which I found its SVG. With the help of Redis, querying large amounts of data remains relatively high-throughput and very performant, though I still have optimizations in mind. <p>At the moment I have no intention to acquire the immeasurable amounts of missing data on my own. The data-sets are complete for the United States, which was my original goal. The scope is just too large for one developer and I'm happy to continue building arbitrary features and implement optimizations. It's an excellent sandbox for sharpening my web development skills.</p><p><b>To fully demonstrate this app, choose The United States from the Economics tab. The Work and Life tabs will become available. Those two tabs are disabled when browsing other countries. Collecting, clearning and aggregating data is very time intensive!</b></p>",
